# face-generator-pytorch
This repository contains a project I completed using PyTorch in the language Python. The generative adversarial network was trained on a set of celebrity faces and can produce new realistic faces. Most of the generated faces look very realistic, but some were produced with interesting splotches of color.

## Installation
The code requires the following packages: torch, torchvision, pickle, matplotlib, numpy

The Jupyter notebook or Python file can be donloaded and run in an environment with the installed packages. The easiest way to set up and run the code in an environment is using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda is a free, open-source platorm to manage libraries, dependencies, and environments.
