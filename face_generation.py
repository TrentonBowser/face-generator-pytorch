# # Face Generation
# 
# In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
# 
# The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from **loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks**. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
# 
# ### Get the Data
# 
# You'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train your adversarial networks.
# 
# This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN) you've been working with, and so, you should prepare to define deeper networks and train them for a longer time to get good results. It is suggested that you utilize a GPU for training.
# 
# ### Pre-processed Data
# 
# Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we've done *some* of the pre-processing for you. Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. Some sample data is show below.
# 
# <img src='assets/processed_face_data.png' width=60% />

# > If you are working locally, you can download this data [by clicking here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/November/5be7eb6f_processed-celeba-small/processed-celeba-small.zip)
# 
# This is a zip file that you'll need to extract in the home directory of this notebook for further loading and processing. After extracting the data, you should be left with a directory of data `processed_celeba_small/`

# In[1]:


#!unzip processed_celeba_small.zip

# ## Visualize the CelebA Data
# 
# The [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations. Since you're going to be generating faces, you won't need the annotations, you'll only need the images. Note that these are color images with [3 color channels (RGB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image)#RGB_Images) each.
# 
# ### Pre-process and Load the Data
# 
# Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we've done *some* of the pre-processing for you. Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. This *pre-processed* dataset is a smaller subset of the very large CelebA data.
# 
# > There are a few other steps that you'll need to **transform** this data and create a **DataLoader**.
# 
# #### Exercise: Complete the following `get_dataloader` function, such that it satisfies these requirements:
# 
# * Your images should be square, Tensor images of size `image_size x image_size` in the x and y dimension.
# * Your function should return a DataLoader that shuffles and batches these Tensor images.
# 
# #### ImageFolder
# 
# To create a dataset given a directory of images, it's recommended that you use PyTorch's [ImageFolder](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder) wrapper, with a root directory `processed_celeba_small/` and data transformation passed in.

# 
# Call the above function and create a dataloader to view images. 
# * You can decide on any reasonable `batch_size` parameter
# * Your `image_size` **must be** `32`. Resizing the data to a smaller size will make for faster training, while still creating convincing images of faces!

    imshow(images[idx])


# #### Exercise: Pre-process your image data and scale it to a pixel range of -1 to 1
# 
# You need to do a bit of pre-processing; you know that the output of a `tanh` activated generator will contain pixel values in a range from -1 to 1, and so, we need to rescale our training images to a range of -1 to 1. (Right now, they are in a range from 0-1.)

#

# ## Discriminator
# 
# Your first task will be to define the discriminator. This is a convolutional classifier like you've built before, only without any maxpooling layers.

# 
# To help your models converge, you should initialize the weights of the convolutional and linear layers in your model. From reading the [original DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf), they say:
# > All weights were initialized from a zero-centered Normal distribution with standard deviation 0.02.
# 
# So, your next task will be to define a weight initialization function that does just this!
# 
# You can refer back to the lesson on weight initialization or even consult existing model code, such as that from [the `networks.py` file in CycleGAN Github repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/models/networks.py) to help you complete this function.

# ## Discriminator and Generator Losses
#

# 
# ### Discriminator Losses
# 
# > * For the discriminator, the total loss is the sum of the losses for real and fake images, `d_loss = d_real_loss + d_fake_loss`. 
# * Remember that we want the discriminator to output 1 for real images and 0 for fake images, so we need to set up the losses to reflect that.
# 
# 
# ### Generator Loss
# 
# The generator loss will look similar only with flipped labels. The generator's goal is to get the discriminator to *think* its generated images are *real*.
